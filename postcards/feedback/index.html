<p>
	1) Design is nice and a coherent aesthetic but some of the pictures are a little pixalated, mostly the second and last one<br>
	2) It might be hard to get the text to go above the characted when there is not space already there above it.<br>
	3) It might look nice to have the text for maybe just the second one be another color other than black, like it could be the pink of her hat or maybe a lighter green like how the first one is a lighter blue.<br>
